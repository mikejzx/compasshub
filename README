compasshub
==========

A second attempt at writing a TUI-based Compass portal client.
Written for my own use, so I don't have to log into Compass every
damn day. Honestly doubt any other human on the planet would need
to use this.

-- -- -- Checklist -- -- --
[x] Ability to retrieve timetable data.
[x] Ability to display timetable data.
[x] Filesystem-caching.
[x] Separate “events” from “periods”.
[x] Login system.
[x] ‘Aliases’ system.

-- -- -- Dependencies -- -- --
- ncurses
- RapidJSON (https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson/)
    Simply clone the repo above's ‘include’ folder into src/rapidjson/ here.
- OpenSSL v1.1 (libssl-dev)
- libcrypto

-- -- -- Preferences -- -- --
CompassHub requires a preferences file, compasshub.prefs, which needs
to be filled with URLs required to connect to the portal site. The main
domain hostname needs to be adjusted to suit the school, but the rest
should work universally assuming Compass uses the same links across
schools. A sample preferences file is provided.

-- -- -- Building -- -- --
The project is Makefile-based. Literally just run `make` and everything
should compile (after a bit of time...)

-- -- -- Running -- -- --
At the moment, the project searches in the working directory for
preferences files, cache, etc. It is advised to run the program from
the directory is was built from.
